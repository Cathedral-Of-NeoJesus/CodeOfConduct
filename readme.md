### 5. Community Rules

**By joining, you acknowledge that you abide to the following rules:**

  1: **NSFW content is not allowed.**
  NSFW is strictly forbidden in all of its forms. Do not attempt to bypass this requirement. We are an open and
  welcoming community, that targets a varied age range, and we want to keep a safe environment for everyone here. You
  may read the [Cornell Law website](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256) for legal information regarding
  what counts as an NSFW content.

  2: **Hateful speech towards others:**
  Hateful speech is not allowed in any form. You are allowed to have your own opinion, but it must follow the widely
  accepted standards of society. Respect to be respected.

  3: **Spam in the general chats:**
  If people are having a conversation, do not flood the chat, there are **PLENTY** of channels for you to spam memes,
  specially the #memes channel

  4: **Piracy:**
  To comply with discord's TOS, sharing links and sources about piracy would get the server in trouble, and as a member
  of the server, you should think twice before taking a decision that may harm the server and it's members. Talking
  about piracy and warning users about unsafe sites should be allowed. HOWEVER, do not give sources to any safe/unsafe
  sites. And as always, just use r/piracy's megathread instead of asking around random people on the internet.

  5: **Support Rules:**
  Tech support regarding anything is provided as is, and should be accessible to anyone in the community. You are
  entitled to help others that may require assistance. You are not "owed" help. People have their own lives, hence
  they're helping voluntarily, and you must therefore respect their free time. You may not ping others that do not want
  to help you. You may link your issue thread, but do not spam it in other channels. Trolling, malicious behaviour,
  and/or shitposting in the support channels is forbidden. You may not provide or ask for remote support via SSH,
  Anydesk, Teamviewer or any other form. By extension, you may not take support to DMs.

  6: **Safety of minors:**
  DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT BREAKS SAFETY OF MINORS. The server admin takes this very seriously, and any breaking of this
  rule can give you a permanent ban and the moderation team can even contact other server mods for a cross-sever ban.


### 6. Joking/Trolling:
  1: **Respect NO:**
  People have their limits, if someone isn't comfortable with your jokes and is telling you to not make that jokes about
  THEM, you should stop before the moderation team has to intervene.

  2: **Saying something is bad doesn’t mean they’re attacking you personally:**
  While you should encourage people's personal work, saying that "x distro is bad" or "y text editor is shit" or "z
  ideology is stupid", does not break the rules. People have their own opinion, and sharing that opinion is not a bad
  thing. People that say these stuff however, be prepared to hear the same thing for other people too.

  3: **Everyone does not have the same humor:**
  gray jokes should be allowed, but Vile dark jokes should not be done in the server since the server has a diverse
  group of people, and we do not want to make anyone feel offended or attacked. Keep edgy stuff in private servers and
  in dms please. (You can also send ingenarel(NeoJesus) dark jokes in his dms since he is a connoisseur of dark humor)

### Last words:
You may report any rule breaking situation and the infractors will be sanctioned properly. You may notify staff and/or
the moderation team by pinging them. A ticketing system will be implemented later.
**Respect the privacy of others.**

# You may not attempt to bypass or find loopholes to the aforementioned rules.
  **Any attempt to do so, will result in moderation actions, and sanctions according to the gravity of the offence.**
