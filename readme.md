  2: **This is not a dating server**.
  Do not hit on people (even accidentally). This server is open to minors, and we can't
  verify anyone's age, so we have to treat all instances as potential interaction with a minor, regardless of how old
  anyone says they are. As an adult, you should be mature, use common sense, and avoid interactions with minors in any form that involves dating or similar.
  If you're a minor, this also applies for the reasons mentioned beforehand. Do not engage in such activities for your own safety.
  By extension, think before you type.

  3: **Hateful speech towards others:**
  Hateful speech is not allowed in any form. You are allowed to have your own opinion, but it must follow the widely accepted standards of society. Respect to be respected.

  Tech support regarding Arch Linux, Linux and related is provided as is, and should be accessible to anyone in the community.
