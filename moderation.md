### 1. Member requirements:
By joining the moderation team, you agree that you have already agreed to everything in the readme.md and the members.md
This is the extra rules that the moderation team needs to follow.

### 2. Wear the server tag:
I want people that are actually dedicated to the server to have the mod role, so wearing the server tag is a must, and
it also helps me advertise the server to more people

### 3. Timeouts first, ban (permaban only) if only necessary:
Discord servers can be a really shitty place sometimes if the moderation team do as they like, people can change and
just outright banning people if you don't like them is a stupid decision. Do timeouts first, and bans only if necessary.
Banning someone should be permanent only, so that's why the idea of a timeout is better than a ban, because the person
in question can also see the server interacting and having fun with each other without them.

However, this does not apply for breaking section 5.6 of the member's code of conduct, or if it's a simple troll that
says slur and/or threats to the people in the server the second they join. One or two mistakes can be pardoned tho

### 4. People have the authority to question you:
You are given this role to ensure the safety and sanity of the community. This is not your own server. This is the
people's server. And expect people to troll/be rude/question you. If you take ban/timeout/mute someone without them
breaking a server rules, then the administration can and probably will remove your mod role.

### 5. Do not purge/delete messages if not necessary:
Do it only if:
1\. Hardcore NSFW
2\. Doxxing someone
3\. Over-spam (the server should have anti-spam enabled tho)
