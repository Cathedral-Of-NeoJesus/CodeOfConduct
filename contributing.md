# "Archverse Community" Code of Conduct contribution rules:

- 1\. When submitting your contribution, please make sure that it doesn't actively violate the current code of
  conduct first. If you have a problem with the current code of conduct, we suggest talking about it in the server,
  opening a Github issue, then submitting your pull request.

- 2\. Any kind of joke contribution / trolling would have consequences. This is the official code of conduct. So
  everyone should behave appropriately.

- 3\. Section 4 and 5 of the Code of Conduct also applies to contributing.

# "Archverse Community" Code of Conduct contribution guidelines:

- 1\. Follow the [conventional commits guidelines][conventional_commits] to *make reviews easier* and to make git logs
  more valuable.
  The structure of a commit message is:
  ```
    type(scope): subject

    rest....
  ```
  For example, when you're editing a section, the commit message can be: `(3.6): add entry for support outside of server
  rules`
  
  Or if you're introducing a new section, the commit message can be: `(3): introduce new entry for <something>`.

- 2\. The contribution guidelines are not HARD RULES. If you have a valid reason to not follow a guideline, feel free to
  do so.
